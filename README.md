A Chrome browser extension to enable Viraam [Breaks/Pause] from Digital Space

## 💡Inspiration

No matter how hard-working you are or how stressful your job is, the human body is not equipped for countless hours of being seated in one position in front of the screen.

It’s no secret that sitting down is slowly killing you. In fact, recently researchers have found a link between sitting for too many hours every day and the risk of early death.

The good news is that taking regular quality breaks can significantly reduce this risk. Furthermore, brief mental breaks will actually help you stay focused on your work and raise your productivity levels.


## 👩🏻‍💻 What is Viraam?
Viraam(વિરામ) is a chrome extension which promotes taking a healthy pause from your desk. Viraam makes you to step away from the computer and perform squats/stretching. Viraam helps you in making your workday routine more healthy.
